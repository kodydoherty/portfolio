Utilize SNMPc Management Console monitor remote satellite SIPR NIPR Access point (SNAP) terminals. Managed and designed custom Access-lists to control user access to remote satellite SNAP terminals for multiple enclaves.Troubleshooting DMVPN tunnel issues by verifying static routing between the taclanes and SNAP networking equipment. This was done by utilizing GemX and walking on site users over the phone on how to troubleshoot the issue. Create custom configurations for Cisco 2811s and its switch module running catalyst 3550 IOS. Debugged and resolved 8 known configurations issues within configuration generator script used by the team. The configuration generator was written with Power shell. I utilized my programming experience isolate and resolve issues within the code. These issues were causing many of the enclaves to not function properly and prevent support staff from accessing some of the routers.Managed IP address pools for each SNAP terminal and insured each terminal had DHCP properly configured.Configured Cisco 7960 & 7940 series IP Phones to work with the terminals on each of its enclaves.Troubleshot configuration issues on both Cisco Unified Call Manager and Gatekeeper routers to resolve Cisco IP Phone issues.Troubleshooting terminal Linkway modem performance issues.Implemented new security requirements by auditing remote SNAP terminals. This included disabling unused ports, applying port security, and sticky MAC configuration changes. This was to insure the terminals met DISSA standards.OSPF route troubleshooting.Created troubleshooting workflow documentation and checklists for Field Service Representatives (FSRs) to assist in building a uniformed set of standards for troubleshooting and setup of the SNAP.Trained FSRs on proper router / switch setup and how to troubleshoot common issues. I also trained them how to perform password recovery on the Cisco equipment in case they were locked out.Trained a few FSRs to fill in as backups for my position while I went on leave. I created full documentation on logical troubleshooting steps for the most common issues."},{employer:"Telecommunication Systems",title:"System Integration/ Linux System Admin",location:"Columbia, MD",dates:"September 2012 - January 2013",description:"Integrating and daily maintenance of an agile, near-real time software system. Perform software installation and configuration activities of both COTS and project-developed software packages. Daily maintenance included monitoring systems during normal business hours and performing as the first line of defense for debugging and resolution of system issues in order to return the system to full functionality operations. System debugging and problem resolution was as varied as searching log files for errors related to users being unable to log into the system, determining the cause of a drive filling up, or hand-feeding data files into the system after a backup due to other issues. This also included team pager duty involving 24/7 support. Experiences on this project included use of Eclipse and SVN (Subversion) for Configuration Management of software configuration changes, ClearQuest for tracking system change requests, SharePoint as a repository for wiki-like information and document storage, and general system debugging in a Linux environment.
